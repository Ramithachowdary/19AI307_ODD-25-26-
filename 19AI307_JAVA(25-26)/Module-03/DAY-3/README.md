# Ex.No:3(C) ABSTRACTION

## QUESTION:
Create abstract class GameScore with method finalScore().  
Subclasses:
ArcadeGame: score = baseScore + (level × 100)
PuzzleGame: score = (attempts ≤ 3) ? 1000 - (attempts × 100) : 500

## AIM:
To write a Java program that uses an abstract class to calculate final game scores for two types of games:  
ArcadeGame and PuzzleGame, each implementing its own scoring logic.

## ALGORITHM:
1. Create an abstract class `GameScore` with the abstract method `finalScore()`.
2. Create subclass `ArcadeGame` with:
   - Attributes: `base`, `level`
   - Scoring rule: `finalScore = base + (level × 100)`
3. Create subclass `PuzzleGame` with:
   - Attribute: `attempts`
   - Scoring rule:
     - If attempts ≤ 3 → `finalScore = 1000 - (attempts × 100)`
     - Else → `finalScore = 500`
4. In the `main` method:
   - Read `type` (1 for ArcadeGame, 2 for PuzzleGame)
   - If `type == 1`:
     - Read `base` and `level`
     - Create `ArcadeGame` object
   - Else:
     - Read `attempts`
     - Create `PuzzleGame` object
   - Call `finalScore()` and print the result.
5. End the program.

## SOURCE CODE:
```java
import java.util.*;

abstract class GameScore
{
    abstract int finalScore();
}

class ArcadeGame extends GameScore
{
    int base;
    int level;
    ArcadeGame(int base,int level)
    {
        this.base=base;
        this.level=level;
    }
    @Override
    int finalScore()
    {
        return (base+(level*100));
    }
}
class PuzzleGame extends GameScore
{
    int attempts;
    PuzzleGame(int attempts)
    {
        this.attempts=attempts;
    }
    @Override
    int finalScore()
    {
        return ((attempts <= 3) ? 1000 - (attempts * 100) : 500);
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int type = sc.nextInt();
        GameScore game;
        
        if (type == 1) {
            int base = sc.nextInt();
            int level = sc.nextInt();
            game = new ArcadeGame(base, level);
        } else {
            int attempts = sc.nextInt();
            game = new PuzzleGame(attempts);
        }
        
        System.out.println(game.finalScore());
    }
}
```

## RESULT:
The program successfully calculates and displays the final score based on game type and user input using abstract methods and dynamic method dispatch.
